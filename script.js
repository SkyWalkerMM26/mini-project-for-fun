//create a document query that links to a button in the index.html
//when the button is clicked, the game will start! wow
//inside our code, we could have a either a variable object or array that contains all of the words selectable for a game
//as for the timer: when the start button is clicked, we enter an interval function that counts down every second.
//if the seconds run out before the word is guessed, the game is cut short and the player loses :(
//using potentially if statement, when a key on the keyboard is pressed, the code checks if said key is in the randomized word picked for the game
//if the key is in fact there, the character in the word will show up!
//these serve as key events, where the blank "_" symbol is then replaced by the correct character
//after every game, we use localStorage to store the win and loss count. we would display this score card after each game
